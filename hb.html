			<h3>STEVE JOBS</h3>
				<div id="jobsText">
					<p><br>After dropping out of Reed College in 1972, Jobs approached his childhood friend Steve Wozniak with an idea to design their own computers. The two would continue to work together on designing and building computer software for Apple's formative years. However, Jobs was often deceptive and demanding of Wozniak, straining their relationship. Jobs was highly ambitious, but insensitive to those around him and often worked manipulatively.Desit being less technically brilliant than Wozniak, Jobs receives a majority of the credit for Apple and its creations.</p>

				<h3>WOZ</h3>
					<div id="wozText">
					<p>Steve Wozniak became friends with Steve Jobs while the two were in high school, and was asked to help Jobs with a computer project while Jobs was working at Atari. Though Wozniak valued the experience of creating and learning about computers, he felt his partner was increasingly focused on the financial aspect of the business. Despite Woz's contribution to Apple, he did not gain the same recognition as Jobs and was relegated to a smaller position in the company once Apple gained traction as a company. In the duo, Woz is regarded as the more talented programmer and software designer, though he lacked Job's vision and mind for business.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
	<p>Apple is now a multi-billion dollar company, and has diversified<br>beyond personal computers with the creation of the iPod, iPad, and its own line of smart phones. Apple's success is evident by the millions<br> of Americans it employs and the company's 215 billion dallar revenue. Apple products consistently utilize cutting edge technology in their software design to remain on the foreground of tech companies.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Wozniak was the primary designer and engineer of Apple. Jobs enlisted him and Ronald Wayne to start Apple in 1976 with the creation of the personal computer kit Apple I. Woz and Jobs worked together in the Jobs' family garage to design the computer. The duo worked alongside members of the Stanford computer club and other ambitious designers, though Wozniak showed resistance towards working in a team. As the company grew, Woz described a shift in direction from technological interest to simple greed on the part of Steve Jobs.</p>
