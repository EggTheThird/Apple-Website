<h2><br>LISA AND CHRISSAN BRENNAN</h2>
	<p>In 1978, Jobs and Chrissan Brennan had a daughter out of wedlock and named her Lisa. Shortly after, Jobs named the design of his personal computer the Apple Lisa, most likely in her honor. Jobs, however, denied his paternal status of Lisa Brennan-Jobs for the entirety of her childhood, even going to court and denying the legitimacy of a DNA paternity test. Despite his wealth, Steve refused to pay child support, leaving Chrissan Brennan to raise their daughter in poverty.</p>
